## Skills and Knowledge Acquired

- 🛠️ **Adapted an Open Source Pipeline**: Successfully adapted an open-source pipeline for applying supervised fine-tuning on a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance its ability to answer user questions.

- 📚 **Mastered Best Practices in Data and Model Management**: Learned and implemented best practices, including versioning data and models, and pre-processing large datasets inside a data warehouse.

- 🤖🔍 **Learned Responsible AI Practices**: Acquired knowledge in responsible AI by learning how to output safety scores on sub-categories of harmful content.


## Key Learnings from the Course

### Overview
In this course, I went through the LLMOps pipeline, focusing on pre-processing training data for supervised instruction tuning. I adapted a supervised tuning pipeline to train and deploy a custom LLM, which is crucial for creating an LLM workflow tailored to specific applications. For instance, I created a question-answer chatbot designed to respond to Python coding queries.

### Key Steps Accomplished in the LLMOps Pipeline

- 🔄 **Retrieved and Transformed Training Data**: Successfully retrieved and transformed training data for supervised fine-tuning of a Large Language Model.

- 📊 **Versioned Data and Tuned Models**: Learned to version data and tuned models to effectively track tuning experiments.

- ⚙️ **Configured and Executed a Supervised Tuning Pipeline**: Configured an open-source supervised tuning pipeline and executed it to train and deploy a tuned LLM.

- 🔍 **Studied Safety Scores for Responsible AI**: Outputted and analyzed safety scores to responsibly monitor and filter the LLM application's behavior.

- 🖥️ **Hands-On Experience with the Tuned LLM**: Tried out the tuned and deployed LLM in a classroom setting.

### Tools Practiced With

- 📈 **BigQuery Data Warehouse**: Gained practical experience with BigQuery for handling large datasets.

- 🧩 **Kubeflow Pipelines**: Utilized the open-source Kubeflow Pipelines in the training and deployment process.

- ☁️ **Google Cloud Platform**: Employed Google Cloud as part of the training and deployment pipeline.
